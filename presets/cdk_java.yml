description: AWS CDK — Java project
long_description: |
  This preset is designed for AWS CDK projects using Java. It focuses on capturing the essential
  source files, configuration files, and scripts while excluding directories that typically contain
  build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is tailored to ensure that
  the core Java files, along with relevant configuration and script files, are included while avoiding
  unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs.
