description: Tests only — capture test files and configs
long_description: |
  This preset is designed for capturing test files and configurations across various programming languages.
  It includes common file extensions used in testing and configuration files, while excluding directories
  that typically contain source code, build artifacts, or other non-essential files. The preset is tailored
  to ensure that the core test files, along with relevant configuration files, are included while avoiding
  unnecessary clutter from source code and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in testing
  and excludes directories that are not relevant to the test files, such as source directories and build
  directories.
