description: Review only preset for code projects
long_description: |
  This preset is designed for code review purposes, focusing on source files and configuration files
  while excluding directories that typically contain build artifacts, dependencies, or large data files.
  It is tailored to ensure that only the essential files needed for code review are included, avoiding
  unnecessary clutter from temporary files, build outputs, and large assets. This preset is ideal for
  reviewing code changes, configurations, and scripts without the overhead of large data files or
  non-essential directories.
