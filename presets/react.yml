  This preset is designed for React projects, focusing on JavaScript and TypeScript source files,
  along with HTML and CSS files. It includes common file extensions used in React development and excludes
  directories that typically contain build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is designed to capture the essential
  source files while avoiding unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs.
