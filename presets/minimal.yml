description: Minimal config — safest default, good as a base template
long_description: |
  This preset is designed to provide a minimal configuration suitable for various projects.
  It focuses on capturing essential source files and configuration files while excluding
  directories that typically contain build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations.
  The preset is tailored to ensure that core files are included while avoiding unnecessary clutter
  from temporary files and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in many projects
  and excludes directories that are not relevant to the source code, such as build directories and IDE
  configurations. This makes it a good starting point for various types of projects, including Python,
  JavaScript, and general software development.
