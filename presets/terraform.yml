long_description: |
  This preset is designed for Terraform projects, focusing on capturing the essential
  source files, configuration files, and scripts while excluding directories that typically contain
  build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is tailored to ensure that
  the core Terraform files, along with relevant configuration and script files, are included while avoiding
  unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in Terraform
  projects and excludes directories that are not relevant to the source code, such as build directories
  and IDE configurations.
