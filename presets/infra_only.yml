description: Infra only — IaC configs (Terraform, Ansible, Helm, K8s YAML)
long_description: |
  This preset is designed for infrastructure-only projects, focusing on Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  configurations such as Terraform, Ansible, Helm, and Kubernetes YAML files. It captures essential
  configuration files while excluding directories that typically contain build artifacts, dependencies,
  or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is designed to ensure that only relevant infrastructure files
  are included, avoiding unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs.
