  This preset is designed for Vue.js projects, focusing on capturing the essential source files,
  configuration files, and scripts while excluding directories that typically contain build artifacts,
  dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is tailored to ensure that the core Vue.js files,
  along with relevant configuration and script files, are included while avoiding unnecessary clutter
  from temporary files and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in Vue.js projects and
  excludes directories that are not relevant to the source code, such as build directories and IDE configurations.
