description: Docs / static site / knowledge base
long_description: |
  This preset is designed for documentation, static sites, or knowledge bases. It focuses on
  capturing essential documentation files, configuration files, and scripts while excluding directories
  that typically contain build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is tailored
  to ensure that the core documentation files, along with relevant configuration and script files, are included
  while avoiding unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs.
