description: Python webapp (FastAPI, Django, Flask, etc.)
long_description: |
  This preset is tailored for Python web applications, including frameworks like FastAPI, Django, and Flask.
  It focuses on capturing the essential source files, templates, static files, and configuration files
  while excluding directories that typically contain build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations.
  The preset is designed to ensure that the core Python files, along with relevant HTML templates,
  JavaScript, CSS, and configuration files, are included while avoiding unnecessary clutter from temporary files
  and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in Python web applications and excludes directories
  that are not relevant to the source code, such as virtual environments, build directories, and IDE configurations.
