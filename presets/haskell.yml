description: Haskell project (Stack or Cabal)
long_description: |
  This preset is tailored for Haskell projects, focusing on source files and configuration files
  used in common Haskell build tools like Stack and Cabal. It includes common file extensions
  used in Haskell development and excludes directories that typically contain build artifacts,
  dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is designed to capture the essential
  source files while avoiding unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs.
