description: Blockchain / Solidity project (smart contracts)
long_description: |
  This preset is designed for Solidity projects, particularly those involving smart contracts on blockchain platforms.
  It focuses on capturing the essential source files, configuration files, and scripts while excluding directories
  that typically contain build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is tailored to
  ensure that the core Solidity files, along with relevant configuration and script files, are included while
  avoiding unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in
  Solidity projects and excludes directories that are not relevant to the source code, such as build directories
  and IDE configurations.
