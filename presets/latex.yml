description: LaTeX / scientific writing project
long_description: |
  This preset is designed for LaTeX projects, focusing on capturing the essential source files,
  configuration files, and scripts while excluding directories that typically contain build artifacts,
  dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is tailored to ensure that the core LaTeX files,
  along with relevant configuration and script files, are included while avoiding unnecessary clutter
  from temporary files and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in LaTeX projects
  and excludes directories that are not relevant to the source code, such as build directories and IDE
  configurations.
