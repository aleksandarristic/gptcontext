long_description: |
  This preset is designed for Node.js applications using TypeScript. It focuses on capturing the essential
  source files, configuration files, and scripts while excluding directories that typically contain
  build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is tailored to ensure that
  the core TypeScript files, along with relevant configuration and script files, are included while avoiding
  unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in Node.js
  projects and excludes directories that are not relevant to the source code, such as build directories
  and IDE configurations. This preset is ideal for applications that utilize TypeScript for development, ensuring
  that the essential files are captured for analysis or deployment while maintaining a clean project structure.
