long_description: |
  This preset is tailored for Unity game projects, focusing on C# scripts, Unity YAML files,
  and configuration files. It includes common file extensions used in Unity development and excludes directories
  that typically contain build artifacts, temporary files, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is designed to capture the essential
  source files while avoiding unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs.
