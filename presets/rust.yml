long_description: |
  This preset is tailored for Rust projects using Cargo as the build system. It focuses on capturing
  the essential source files, configuration files, and scripts while excluding directories that typically
  contain build artifacts, dependencies, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is designed to ensure
  that the core Rust files, along with relevant configuration and script files, are included while avoiding
  unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs. It includes common file extensions used in Rust
  projects and excludes directories that are not relevant to the source code, such as build directories
  and IDE configurations.
