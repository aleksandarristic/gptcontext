  This preset is designed for Unreal Engine projects, focusing on C++ source files, configuration files,
  and Unreal-specific files. It includes common file extensions used in Unreal Engine development and excludes directories
  that typically contain build artifacts, intermediate files, or IDE-specific configurations. The preset is tailored to ensure that
  the core Unreal Engine files, along with relevant configuration and script files, are included while avoiding
  unnecessary clutter from temporary files and build outputs. It captures the essential source files
  while excluding directories that are not relevant to the source code, such as build directories and IDE configurations.
